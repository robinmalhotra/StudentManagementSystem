textsize must be in sp)-3

Modularity:(needs to separate the code in methods.



Validation class should be different not multiple if else ,
GetAdapter position should be used in adapter and ItemView On click should be used in onBindViewHolder,
If code is same in 2 case, you should make one method for that(View student and Edit student).No need to use extra setters and getters to set position in same class like student activity
Code separation is not there in onCreate of a class, init functions not used
EditText should not be init more than one times in same class
No red warning in manifest file like wrong redirections of classes and broadcast

EditText should not be init more than one times in same class
Code separation is not there in onCreate of a class, init functions not used
If code is written more than one time create a function of that
No need to use extra setters and getters to set position in same class like student activity
Constants should be in constant class and Constant file should be interface

Param should be mention in function comments
Unused comment should be removed
Error messages should be correct
